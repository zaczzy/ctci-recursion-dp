Omitting this question to come back later.

Basic idea is to use T[i, j] to represent numWays to parenthesize between i and j to get True;
F[i, j] to represent numWays to parenthesis between i and j to get False.

Total[i, j] = T[i, j] + F[i, j];

Recursion of F[i, j] and T[i, j] involves picking operator k between i and j and the type of operator k is: 
& , | , ^(XOR)
